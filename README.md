# UFOs
## Overview
Creating a webpage with a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by giving the users an ability to filter multiple criteria at the same time. Additionaly adding table filters for city,state,country, and shape to our tables. 

## Results
The webpage UFO Sightings - The Truth is Out There has been created. Upon entering, visitors embarking on their "first encounter" will see:

We will see that a filter section has been added to allow the user to trim down the data.You can filter by one or all of the search criteria shown. For example, if you search by "City", you will see that the table updated to show the reported sightings that was recorded for that specific city.

## Summary

We can see that the website is rough around the edges.

The search field is "case-sensitive". The table will not update if you do not enter exactly how the data is stored and does not allow for partial entries. This is an issue because it does not intuitively tell the user how the information should be entered other than the "default" example shown.

There is no button to click, wording or action that tells the user that the table will update after you hit "enter".

The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

I would advise modifications to the page.

With the following enhancements, it can greatly improve the user's experience.

Add additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.

Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to only the United States, but globally.

Add a "Latest News" section that will highlight an article showing the most recent reported sighting.
